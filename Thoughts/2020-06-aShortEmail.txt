Online Jupyter Notebooks have many drawbacks. Right now I can say:
- Bad support for modeling. No support for sharing models across notebooks. As a consequence, no support for model versioning or evolution.
- Python encourages the use of pre-built, external libraries. Python code is usually just glue code, not models.
- Python models (if they exist) are not separated from glue code and other accidental complexity.
- Content is linear, evaluation is, by default, linear.
- Poor integration with text. Poor text support.
- Poor support for other kinds of media.
- Poor / no support for integrating datasets.
- No support for discussion, evaluation, re-publication.

Jupyter Notebooks are already way worse than what we can do in a Workspace. And when we talk Dynabook, we imagine something way better that a Workspace!
